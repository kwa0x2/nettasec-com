IaaS provides virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines and storage, allowing users to build and manage their own IT infrastructure. PaaS offers a platform for developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about underlying infrastructure. SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for users to install and maintain software locally."

Users can scale computing resources up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization. Cloud computing also enables organizations to quickly deploy new applications and services, reducing time-to-market and improving agility. Additionally, cloud computing eliminates the need for upfront capital investment in hardware and software, as users pay only for the resources they consume on a subscription basis."
